# CSC225-Task_9

Research using the jQuery .prepend() method (http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)

Using the class’ https://csc225.matgargano.com/bootstrap and add:

    – An input of type text
    – An input of type button with the text “Prepend”
    – A div with an id of tasks (div#tasks) that is empty on page load
They should be styled using Bootstrap’s form component classes (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/forms/)

Functionality:

When the user clicks on the button, it should perform the following:

    – Validate that text has been input
    – If so, prepend a paragraph element to the div#tasks with the contents of the input
    – Feel free to add any other IDs/classes/etc. that help get the task completed.
